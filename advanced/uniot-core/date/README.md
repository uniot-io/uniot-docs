# Date

The `Date` module is responsible for managing system time synchronization and providing reliable time-related functionalities. Leveraging Network Time Protocol (NTP) through the `SimpleNTP` utility, the `Date` class ensures accurate and consistent timekeeping across devices.

### Components

[**Date**](date.md)

The `Date` class provides functionalities to synchronize system time with NTP servers, retrieve the current time, and manage time-related events. It ensures that the system maintains accurate time, which is essential for various operations such as logging, scheduling, and data timestamping.

[**SimpleNTP**](simplentp.md)

The `SimpleNTP` class manages the communication with NTP servers to obtain accurate epoch times. It handles the construction and parsing of NTP packets, manages retries and timeouts, and integrates with the `Date` class through callback mechanisms.
