# Sandbox

The Sandbox is an integrated environment that enables you to:

* **Create Scripts**: Use the [Visual Editor](visual-editor/) or write [UniotLisp](../../advanced/uniot-lisp/language-description.md) scripts directly.
* **Emulate and Debug**: Test code with the built-in [emulator](emulator.md) and [logger](logger.md) before deploying to real hardware.
* **Deploy to Device**: Upload the script to your microcontroller, where it runs autonomously.

You can create a script using the **Visual Editor** or by writing **UniotLisp** code directly in the code editor. Note that you can not use both tools at the same time: if you start writing **UniotLisp** code by yourself, you will not be able to use the visual editor. You will need to recompile your visual blocks to synchronize the code editor with the visual editor.

## Key Features

* [**Visual Editor**](visual-editor/): Build scripts using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
* **Code Editor**: Write and edit **UniotLisp** code for advanced logic.
* [**Logger**](logger.md): Monitor script execution and debug issues efficiently.
* [**Emulator**](emulator.md): Test code in a simulated environment.
