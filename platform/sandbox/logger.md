# Logger

The Logger provides a centralized view of script execution, allowing you to monitor and debug your code in real time. The Logger captures output from the UniotLisp interpreter, including:

- **Primitive Logs** - Displays interactions with primitives, such as values read from or written to pins.
- **Event Logs** - Shows triggered events and their associated values.

In future updates, the Logger will also include logs sent by the print block from the "Text" section, enabling detailed insights into MQTT communications and script outputs.

The Logger is an essential tool for understanding the behavior of your script and ensuring its reliability before deployment.
