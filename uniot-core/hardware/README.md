# Hardware

The `Hardware` module provides essential interfaces and classes for managing physical hardware components. This module abstracts the complexities of hardware interactions, offering a streamlined and intuitive framework for integrating sensors, actuators, and other hardware peripherals. By encapsulating hardware functionalities, the `Hardware` module enables the development of responsive and reliable hardware-driven features without delving into low-level hardware control intricacies.

### Components

[**Button**](button.md)

The `Button` class represents a hardware button within the Uniot Core. It provides mechanisms for detecting clicks and long presses, executing callbacks in response to these events, and managing internal state for debouncing and event triggering. By encapsulating button functionality, `Button` simplifies the integration of physical buttons.
