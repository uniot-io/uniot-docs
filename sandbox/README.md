# Sandbox

The Sandbox is an integrated environment that enables you to:

* **Create Scripts**: Use the [Visual Editor](visual-block-editor/) or write LISP scripts directly.
* **Emulate and Debug**: Test code with the built-in emulator and logger before deploying to real hardware.
* **Deploy to Device**: Upload the script to your microcontroller, where it runs autonomously.

You can create a script using the visual editor or by writing LISP code directly in the code editor. Note that you can not use both tools at the same time: if you start writing LISP code by yourself, you will not be able to use the visual editor. You will need to recompile your visual blocks to synchronize the code editor with the visual editor.

## Key Features

* [**Visual Editor**](visual-block-editor/): Build scripts using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
* **Code Editor**: Write and edit LISP code for advanced logic.
* **Emulator**: Test code in a simulated environment.
* **Logger**: Monitor script execution and debug issues efficiently.
